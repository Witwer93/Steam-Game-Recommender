# Steam Game Recommender
 A Machine Learning Project

The goal is to create a recommendation system using the LightFM ML library.

To do:
1. clean/comment all code
2. construct a front end webpage to query steam_id numbers and display recommendations
3. redo powerpoint presentation to include ML results
4. acquire more steam users to improve overall recommendation system
5. construct item-item matrix for games based on genre, length, price, average-time-invested, etc.
6. construct additional matricies where useful

As it is now, my project still needs several layers of polish. I had very high hopes for this project and I believe I can turn it into something valuable, but at the moment it just barely meets project requirements.
